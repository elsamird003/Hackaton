# Ueat

The Ueat App helps a user plan out their meals based on food they currently have in their fridge.


The user would input all the ingredients they have in their fridge as well as possibly list any allergies, and dietary requirements. Then the program will generate a list of potential dishes/recipes they could possibly make based on their ingredients and dietary preferences.
