# Ueat

The Ueat App helps a user plan out their meals based on food they currently have in their fridge.


The user inputs all the ingredients they have in their fridge, after which the program generates a list of potential dishes/recipes they could possibly make based on their ingredients, including the serving size and preparation time. The app also displays the percent match between the recipe ingredients and the user-inputted ingredients, listing out which are missing in both categories.
